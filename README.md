# [Dual Attention Network for Scene Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.02983.pdf)

## Introduction

We propose a Dual Attention Network (DANet) to adaptively integrate local features with their global dependencies based on the self-attention mechanism. And we achieve new state-of-the-art segmentation performance on three challenging scene segmentation datasets, i.e., Cityscapes, PASCAL Context and COCO Stuff-10k dataset.

## Cityscapes testing set result

We train our DANet-101 with only fine annotated data and submit our test results to the official evaluation server.
